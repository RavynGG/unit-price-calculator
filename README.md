# 🏷️ Unit Price Calculator

A simple **Unit Price Calculator** built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **React.js**.

## ⚙️ How It Works

This tool calculates the **unit price** of an item using its **total cost** and **quantity**.  
In grocery stores and retail, items often display a "unit price" so you can compare value across brands and package sizes.  
This calculator lets you double-check accuracy and avoid being overcharged.
